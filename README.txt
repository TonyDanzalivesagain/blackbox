# blackbox software needed to monitor serial traffic on COM port and write to logfiles for given bits, OS=Windows XP embedded.  I'm new at programming, but I think I'd like to use Python to accomplish this.  There is a C++ exe interfacing via TCP/IP and serial.  A program running independent of the C++exe would be prefferable monitoring the all IO...same concept as a blackbox on anairplane...
